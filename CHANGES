It's Dangerous (SHA256 fork) Changelog
------------------------

Version 0.12-sha256
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Changed hashing algorithm from SHA1 to SHA256.

Version 0.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a problem with the local timezone being used for the epoch
  calculation.  This might invalidate some of your signatures if you
  were not running in UTC timezone.  You can revert to the old behavior
  by monkey patching itsdangerous.EPOCH.

Version 0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an uncought value error.

Version 0.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refactored interface that the underlying serializers can be swapped by
  passing in a module instead of having to override the payload loaders
  and dumpers.  This makes the interface more compatible with Django's
  recent changes.
